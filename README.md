# loan-prediction

This is my capstone project for my computer science bachelors program. 

I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle and used Jupyter notebook to predict the probability of getting approved for a loan 
I then used Flask and Heroku to create a website for a fictional company, Faux Mortgage Group
